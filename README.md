Database Creation, Deletion &EOM
We start with Pluggable Database Creation as in Image numbered 1
In Image numbered 2, we open our created Database
With Image 3 we get the CON_IDs
Pluggable database is altered in Image 4
In Image 5, a user named de_plsqlauca (de Being the first two letters of my name Deborah) is created and given all the privileges
DE_TO_DELETE_PDB is created in image 6
Then in Image 7, DE_TO_DELETE_PDB is altered
With Images 8,9 and 10 we get the directory path
After getting the directory path, de_to_delete_pdb is unplugged in image 11
And it is dropped in image 12
We get our http with image 13
The processes in image 14 and 15 direct us to the opening of Oracle Enterprise Manager
With an Image named Full dashboard we get the dashboard of our EOM
Which marks the end of the task.
